## This repo contains my notes when I was learing to use Vim

- Vim has normally has 2 modes
  - Normal mode
  - Insert mode

**NORMAL MODE**
- Normal mode is already activated when you open a file
- You can activate "Insert mode" by pressing the `i` key on the keyboard
- When in the Insert mode you can edit the file and save and exit it.

**EXITING VIM**

- To exit the vim editor we use the `:q` command
- To save and exit the file we use the `:wq` command
- The `!` symbol in vim commands is used to force things, kinda like the `--force` flag in github.

**Moving around in vim**

- When in normal mode you use the `h,j,k and l` keys to move around
- we use the h key to move `left`
- we use the l key to move `right`
- we use the j key to move down one line
- we use the k key to move up one line
- to reach the next sentence we use the `shift  + 0` OR `)` symbol
- to reach the previous sentence we use the `shift  + 9` OR `(` symbol
- `w` will move to the beggining of the next word
- `e` will move to the end of the current word
