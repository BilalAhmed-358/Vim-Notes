## This repo contains my notes when I was learing to use Vim

- Vim has normally has 2 modes
  - Normal mode
  - Insert mode

**NORMAL MODE**
- Normal mode is already activated when you open a file
- You can activate "Insert mode" by pressing the `i` key on the keyboard
- When in the Insert mode you can edit the file and save and exit it.

**EXITING VIM**

- To exit the vim editor we use the `:q` command
- To save and exit the file we use the `:wq` command
- The `!` symbol in vim commands is used to force things, kinda like the `--force` flag in github.
